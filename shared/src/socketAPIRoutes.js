/**
 * NOTE: (jh) This documentation isn't conventional JSDoc, and I'm not yet sure
 * of the best way to go about documenting this.
 * @link https://jsdoc.app/tags-event.html
 *
 * However, in an effort to document it at all, the following is the
 * convention:
 *
 * - (at)event --name-- Represents the event name
 * - (at)type: Represents the request data from the client
 * - (at)property: {function: --type--} ack Represents the response data from
 * the server
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Though a reasonable attempt to document these properties was
 * made, there is no guarantee that the properties are / will be current, and
 * the actual usages of these should be handled in a single wrapper, per route.
 * Having the implementation in one place is the sole source of truth for how
 * these properties are actually utilized.
 *
 * As a final word, many objects in here don't have their schemas documented
 * simply for the sake that maintaining them here would be more trouble than
 * it's worth than to just look up the token (event constant name) directly and
 * see how it's utilized throughout the program. There should not be many
 * instances of any of them, typically one for the frontend and another for the
 * backend, with the exception of this "shared" file.
