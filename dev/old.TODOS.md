## Old TODOs

Current issues are available at https://github.com/zenOSmosis/speaker.app/issues.

### High Priority

  - [in-progress] Fork SimplePeer (client-side) and error logging for all calls to destroy()
  - [-] Use same simple-peer fork on server as in client
  - [done] Implement initiator connection auto-reconnect (see simple-peer "close" in ZenRTCPeer)
- [partially-complete] Implement media stream track synchronization
  See https://www.kevinmoreland.com/articles/03-22-20-webrtc-mediastream-tracks
