quote
  Your limitation — it’s only your imagination
  Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you
  Sometimes later becomes never. Do it now
  Great things never come from comfort zones
  Dream it. Wish it. Do it.
  Success doesn’t just find you. You have to go out and get it.
  The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieve it.
  Dream bigger. Do bigger.
  Don’t stop when you’re tired. Stop when you’re done.
  Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction.
  Do something today that your future self will thank you for.
  Little things make big days
  It’s going to be hard, but hard does not mean impossible.
  Don’t wait for opportunity. Create it.
  Sometimes we’re tested not to show our weaknesses, but to discover our strengths.
  The key to success is to focus on goals, not obstacles.
  Dream it. Believe it. Build it.
  All Gas No Brakes
  Plagiarism saves time
  The beatings will continue until morale improves
  You Miss 100% of the Shots You Never Take
  A rising tide lifts all boats
  DM's are open 
  Add my song to all relevant playlists

  Don’t tell people your plans. Show them your results.
  We can do anything we want to if we stick to it long enough.
  Stay foolish to stay sane.
  When nothing goes right, go left.
  Take the risk or lose the chance.
  here is no saint without a past, no sinner without a future. 
  Good things happen to those who hustle.
  Prove them wrong.
  Screw it, let’s do it.
  Keep going. Be all in.
  Diamond Hands 
  It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice.
  It's not the number of breaths we take, but the number of moments that take our breath away
  Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.
  Live for the nights you'll never remember with the friends you'll never forget
  You have to look through the rain to see the rainbow.
  Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.
  Live every day like it's your last.
  Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.
  Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain.
  "Leave Quietly" is a vibe
