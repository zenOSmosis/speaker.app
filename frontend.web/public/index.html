          <p>
            Speaker.app is an alternative free speech audio platform that is
            compatible on any device that supports a modern web browser.
          </p>

          <div>
            <h2>No User Account or Password Required / Completely Anonymous</h2>
            <p>No user account or password is necessary to start talking.</p>
            <p>
              User identities are based on Ethereum blockchain and are
              automatically generated when a user connects. The user identity is
              not currently written to the real blockchain, but serves as an
              internal identification based on Ethereum addresses.
            </p>
            <p>
              The server only "knows" peers by their Ethereum address and (more
              temporary) Socket.io id.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>Quasi-Decentralized &amp; Open-Source</h2>
            <p>
              Calls are routed through other peers which choose to be network
              hosts; our server acts as a WebRTC signaling mechanism (via
              Socket.io) and for distributing the app on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a centralized MongoDB instance which contains network
              routing information to room hosts, and our intention for others
              who do not want this type of centralization to host it themselves.
            </p>

              to do transcoding tests (and are very pleased with the
              performance). We host our Docker-based infrastructure with

          <div>
            <h2>Scaling</h2>
            <p>
              Speaker.app establishes a proxy through the host's web browser,
              which transcodes streams from each participant to every other
              participant, acting a bit like an
              <a href="https://webrtcglossary.com/mcu/" target="_blank"
                >MCU (Multipoint Conferencing Unit)</a
              >. and an
              <a href="https://webrtcglossary.com/sfu/" target="_blank"
                >SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)</a
              >, progromatically able to emulate both at the same time, while
              also able to manipulate broadcast streams in real-time.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the greatest advantages to such an architecture is that it
              offers the ability to serve thousands of sub-networks from a
              single Node.js server, while the transcoding web browsers handle
              the work of transcoding the streams to and from each participant.
            </p>

            <p>
              It also means that updates to the system are easily propagated to
              all hosting transcoders (web browsers) and any clients (also web
              browsers), as a refresh of the system will result in the latest
              software being run, automatically.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore the network is designed (and an ongoing consideration
              to improve) to transmit as little information through the server,
              and mostly rely on P2P (peer-to-peer; or in our case
              peer-to-browser-based-network-host) connectivity established by
              WebRTC.
